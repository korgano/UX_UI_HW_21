                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">Stereolithography was the world’s first 3D printing technology, invented in the 1980s, and is still one of the most popular technologies for professionals. SLA 3D printers use a laser to cure liquid resin into hardened plastic in a process called photopolymerization.  
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">SLA resin 3D printers have become vastly popular for their ability to produce high-accuracy, isotropic, and watertight prototypes and parts in a range of advanced materials with fine features and smooth surface finish. SLA resin formulations offer a wide range of optical, mechanical, and thermal properties to match those of standard, engineering, and industrial thermoplastics.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">Resin 3D printing a great option for highly detailed prototypes requiring tight tolerances and smooth surfaces, such as molds, patterns, and functional parts.

                <h5 class="card-title">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">Selective laser sintering (SLS) 3D printers use a high-power laser to sinter small particles of polymer powder into a solid structure. The unfused powder supports the part during printing and eliminates the need for dedicated support structures. This makes SLS ideal for complex geometries, including interior features, undercuts, thin walls, and negative features. Parts produced with SLS printing have excellent mechanical characteristics, with strength resembling that of injection-molded parts.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">The most common material for selective laser sintering is nylon, a popular engineering thermoplastic with excellent mechanical properties. Nylon is lightweight, strong, and flexible, as well as stable against impact, chemicals, heat, UV light, water, and dirt.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">The combination of low cost per part, high productivity, and established materials make SLS a popular choice among engineers for functional prototyping, and a cost-effective alternative to injection molding for limited-run or bridge manufacturing.</p>

                </h5>
           <p class="card-text">Fused deposition modeling (FDM), also known as fused filament fabrication (FFF), is the most widely used type of 3D printing at the consumer level. FDM 3D printers work by extruding thermoplastic filaments, such as ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), PLA (Polylactic Acid), through a heated nozzle, melting the material and applying the plastic layer by layer to a build platform. Each layer is laid down one at a time until the part is complete.
           </p>
           <p class="card-text">FDM 3D printers are well-suited for basic proof-of-concept models, as well as quick and low-cost prototyping of simple parts, such as parts that might typically be machined. However, FDM has the lowest resolution and accuracy when compared to SLA or SLS and is not the best option for printing complex designs or parts with intricate features. Higher-quality finishes may be obtained through chemical and mechanical polishing processes. Industrial FDM 3D printers use soluble supports to mitigate some of these issues and offer a wider range of engineering thermoplastics, but they also come at a steep price.</p>

       </p>
       <p class="card-text">Dual extruder printers allow you to print multiple colors in one item, multiple items at the same time, or allow you to use dissolvable support material while printing complex items with lots of overhangs.</p>

                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene a.k.a. ABS filament is the most popular or commonly used 3D printer filament. In fact, it is used in a wide variety of applications because it is tough and high impact-resistant.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">This filament is also strong and slightly flexible, which makes it a good material for 3D printing. In addition, it can be easily extruded, which makes it very easy to print.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">It is available in 3.0mm and 1.75mm diameter at 2 lbs, 5 lbs, and 10 lbs spools. There are also ABS engineering-grade filaments on the market if you want one.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text"><b>Print Temperature Range:</b> 210°C – 250°C</p>
                <p class="card-text">ASA filament functions as an amorphous variant of thermoplastic polymer that stands for Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate. It is generally used as the substitute filament for ABS. The ASA filament has so many advantages in terms of application that it is being used by the topmanufacturers of the automotive industry. The most prominent feature of ASA is the fact that it doesn’t yellow easily.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">Basically, ASA is ABS that is resistant to ultraviolet light and immersion to water, which makes it better for some applications.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Unfortunately, both versions put out a lot of fumes when they're printed and are sensitive to temperature changes, so you'll need to print in a well ventilated area and possibly use an enclosure. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Polylactic acid or PLA filament is one of the most commonly used 3D printing materials that is often compared against ABS. PLA is a biodegradable thermoplastic that is derived from renewable resources like cornstarch, sugar cane, tapioca roots, and potato starch.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">This 3D print filament is more environment-friendly compared to other plastic materials. Due to this and its low-toxicity features, more and more prefer PLA over ABS. Furthermore, it is even one of the most popular 3D printing plastics in the 3D printing community.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">In contrast to ABS, PLA filament doesn’t produce toxic stinks during printing, so it is safer to use within homes and classrooms. Due to its safe and non-toxic nature, this filament is the best 3D printer filament for kids who love 3D printing.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most commonly used plastics in the world. Best known as the polymer used in water bottles, it is also found in clothing fibers and food containers. While “raw” PET is rarely used in 3D printing, its variant PETG is an increasingly popular 3D printer filament.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">The ‘G’ in PETG stands for “glycol.” As a material for 3D printing, it is naturally clearer, less brittle, and most importantly, easier to print with than its base form. For this reason, PETG is often considered a good middle ground between ABS and PLA, two other commonly used types of 3D printer filament – it is more flexible and durable than PLA and easier to print than ABS.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">IPolyethylene coTrimethylene Terephthalate (PETT) is another PET variant. Slightly more rigid than PETG, this 3D printer filament is popular for its transparency.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text"><b>Print Temperature Range:</b> 220°C – 245°C</p>
            <p class="card-text">PETG is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. This has a negative effect on the printability of the material, so make sure to store the 3D printer filament in a cool, dry place and, if necessary, dry it before use.

            <p class="card-text">Polyvinyl Alcohol better known as PVA filament is another great 3D filament. PVA is a special plastic that is water-soluble. This type of filament is based on polyvinyl alcohol, so it has pretty good properties like being non-toxic and biodegradable. It is the most popular support material in the market.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">PVA is easy to print that’s why they make good support during a printing process for models with overhangs that is impossible to print without support material.

            <p class="card-text">The TPE filament has high elastic characteristics that it feels like a rubber. It bounces back and forth into shape. Moreover, this material is good for FDM printers and can be used for ABS and PLA filaments. It can also withstand tough environments that ABS and PLA can’t.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text"><b>Print Temperature Range:</b> 225°C – 235°C</p>
            <p class="card-text">TPU filament. This is made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), a class of polyurethane plastics with several significant properties such as elasticity, transparency, and resistance to grease, oil and abrasion. TPU filament is extremely flexible by nature.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">A TPU filament is made up of thermoplastic elastomers. However, it’s better to separate them from acids, solvents and fuels which can affect their properties.
